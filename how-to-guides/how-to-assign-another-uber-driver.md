**Important Notes:**

* If the delivery was accidentally cancelled by Uber or the store, or if no driver accepted the delivery, you may set the order back to “**Confirmed**” status and then request another driver.
* This option is usually available a few minutes after the order is initially created.
* Once requested, the system will automatically look for a new Uber driver in the area.
